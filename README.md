OnlineBirthDeathRegistration
============================

Abstract

The Registration of Birth and Death incidents in Tamil Nadu is done mostly through manual intervention. Our objective here is to auotmate the process with computers to a good extent. We propose a web application hosted by the Government of Tamil nadu. This will be available to both the officers in the Registration department and the public. 

The system requires the citizens to register themselves and allows them to raise request to register birth and death incidents. Once a request is initiated, the Registrar will be able to see them, does a preliminary validation, and process the request. If the incident date falls past 365 days, the request will be processed by the Commissioner. Various reports could be extracted from this system like number of births, deaths happening across the year, pending requests at this point, reports based on cause of death etc. We are developing this system with Service oriented architecture so that the data can be used across other Government departments with a minimum effort. Also some of the reports (based on the sensitivity of the information ) could be made available public.
